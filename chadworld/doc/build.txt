ChadWorld uses Jakarta-Ant for the build system.  Visit
http://jakarta.apache.org/ant/ for information and downloads.

ChadWorld also requires Java3D.  If you use the Java3D installer at
http://java.sun.com/products/java-media/3D/, you shouldn't have to
modify your PATH or CLASSPATH at all.  If you're on the CS machines in
Atanasoff, or any other machine where you don't have administrative
access, download the JAR and DLL files at
http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/isugamedev/j3d.tar.bz2.  You must
add every JAR file to your CLASSPATH.  If you put them in H:\j3d, for
example, type:

set CLASSPATH=%CLASSPATH%;H:\j3d\j3daudio.jar;H:\j3d\j3dcore.jar;H:\j3d\j3dutils.jar;H:\j3d\vecmath.jar

Add the DLL files to your current directory.

Now that you have both ant and Java3D installed, simply type "ant" to
compile.  Type "java chadworld.Server" to run the server, and
"java chadworld.Client" to run the client.
