ChadWorld Test Plan


Since the bulk of the operations in ChadWorld are user-initiated, it
is difficult to build accurate unit tests for the system.
Fortunately, manual testing is not (at this stage) very difficult.
Whenever the software changes, I run through the following steps:

1) start the server
2) connect to the server with one client
3) walk forwards and backwards
4) turn around in a circle
5) connect with another client
6) type text into both clients
7) position the views such that each player can view the other player's text
8) disconnect one player from the server, verify that the player is removed
   from the world
9) disconnect the other player from the server, verify that both players are
   removed from the database and the server does not crash


Unit Tests:

chadworld/test contains a single unit test for the entity database class.
