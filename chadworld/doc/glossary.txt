Avatar - A physical object representing the player within the world.
	 Avatars show the location of your player to the other players
	 viewing the system.

Behavior - A Java3D scene graph node that simply manipulates the state
	   of the system.  Behaviors have no physical representation
	   within the scene.

Client - The program that connects to the server over the network and
	 displays the world.

Client Frame - Window on the client that contains the 3D
	       representation of the world.

Entity - Some physical object within the scene.  There are static
	 entities (world elements) and dynamic entities (avatars).
	 Static entities do not move within the world.  Dynamic
	 entities can change position and orientation.

Packet - An atomic chunk of data that is passed across a network
	 connection.  There are several types of packets: Some
	 represent login requests, some represent updates to the world
	 information, others represent input events such as
	 keypresses.

Scene Graph - A heirarchical representation of a scene.  Scene graphs
	      are a popular way to organize spatially related objects.
	      PGI Performer, OpenSceneGraph, OpenSG, and Java3D are
	      all scene graphs.

Server - The program that runs on one computer and handles the world
	 and all client connections.
