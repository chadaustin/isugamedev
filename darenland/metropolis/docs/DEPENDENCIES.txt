Deps:

Python: the python framework is required to build the parser into metropolis. This
	is used for scripting game logic, basically handling the rule-set.

Boost headers: used for their magical shared_ptr class. They make the baby jesus happy.

Boost.Python: the boost python library must be available so that our python scripts
	can import and use C++ libraries. This is a major element of the app architecture.

Boost.Spirit: used to define the grammer of our data files, and generate parsers for them.
	(this may only be needed the first time we generate them.)

OpenGL: obviously.

SDL: cross-platform framework for 3d context creation and input handling.

SCons: the build system that we will use on linux and likely on windows as well (also
	maybe Visual Studio).
