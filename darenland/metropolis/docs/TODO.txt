Todo:

Figure out where we want to calculate DT and implement.

Start an Entity inheritance tree.

Define a grammer for object and map files, and get all that compiled.

Loaders for the object and map files. (including data structures to load into)

Start on the Event structure, hopefully we can get an inputHandler going here pretty quickly.

Expand on this TODO list.
