  1  System Description





     1.1 System Description 



     Warn-a-Brotha uses client-server architecture to allow for multiple people to play a racing game at the same time.  The client is a relatively simple system, which does little more then display the world and move around as the server tells it to.  The client uses the networking components (connection manager, networking, threading) as well as the input, sound, texture, and UI components.  The server is much more sophisticated, responsible for managing the state of the world, calculating the physics, storing all the game world related data, as well as handling requests for reports based on the data.  It uses the Connection Manager, Data, Game Logic, Network, Report server, and of course the Thread subsystems. 



     The client/server networking will be over TCP/IP using our own networking object library, which will include a socket, stream, and serialization subsystem.  The report server will use the same socket libraries, but be based on HTTP, so that you'll just need a web browser to query against it. 



     The client side graphics will be displayed using OpenGL 3D rendering, input will be handled using GameKernel, and will be converted into command requests which will be sent to the server to be processed.



     The Game Logic component will handle user commands sent to the server and apply to the game world's state.

     

      

     1.2  Description of test environment.

     

     The system will be tested on both windows and Linux, using a combination of CppUnit and custom made testing programs.  The tests will be conducted by individual group members on their personal computers.





     1.3 Test phase overview





       1.3.1 test preparation



       The code will be prepared for use with CppUnit, and custom mini-programs will be written to test parts of the system.

          

       1.3.2 execution



       The test programs will be run, and the output may be examined manually or automatically.



       1.3.3 in case of anomaly



       If an anomaly is detected, the error will be recorded, and testing will continue, later the bug will be tracked down and corrected, and testing will commence again.



 



  2  Major Tests.





     2.1 Unit tests.



     



     2.2 integration tests





     

     2.3 functional tests







-- p5 (Test Description Only TWO tests in detail)





   3 Test Descriptions  



       

      3.1 Network



          (for each test)

          1 Requirements

          2 Methods

          3 Test Procedures





      3.2 Data XML subsystem



          (for each test)

          1 Requirements

          2 Methods

          3 Test Procedures





          Test 32A Storage/save test:

          Requirements



            Functions: XML API for populating data, data saving



          Methods



            White box testing will be used, in order to assure that all the code works, all the different types of information used by the system will be entered.



          Test procedures.



            A short program will be written to populate the data structure with pre-defined information using the API, and the XML structure will be written out to the console.  That structure will be visually analyzed to make sure all the information is present.  The test data used will fill the structure with all used information.

          





          Test 32B Data loading test

          Requirements 



            Functions: loading and saving data.



          Methods

          

            White box testing will be used as in the test 32B.



          Test procedures



          

            An XML file will be written that includes all the possible types of information available to the system.  A short program will be written that will load the file into memory, and then re-encode it into XML.  The resulting XML file will then be compared with the original.

           

          

        



      3.3 Game Logic

        

	  Test 33A Adding and removing players to game
	    
  	  Requirements/ functions tested
	    
	    Requirements:  5.01, 5.02
	    Functions:  Adding and removing players from game.

	  Methods
	
	      White box testing will be used to execute every line of code in the adding players and removing players functions.

	    Test procedures

	      A function was created that lists off every player in the game at one given moment.  A program was then created that would add many different players and print off the results after each addition; the program would then delete the names in random order until all the players were deleted from the game.

        Test 33B Moving the vehicle

	  Requirements/ functions tested

          Requirements:  3.1, 3.2, 3.4, 3.5 (3.3 is no longer relevant)
	    Functions:  process input.

	  Methods

	    Black box testing will be used to test functionality for acceleration, velocity, and turning left and right.

	  Test procedures

            These functions just query for input and see which buttons are being pressed.  To test these we will be in the actual program and go through each of the command and determine how well each command is implemented.  We should be able so see physically how the vehicle moves and determine whether or not it is an acceptable function.  	




      3.4 Report Server



           

          

          Test 34A Report generation



          Requirements/ functions tested



           Requirements: 5.3, 5.3.5, 5.3.5.1, 5.3.5.2 (5.3.5.2 is no longer relevant)

           Functions: report generation.



          Methods



            White box testing will be used to execute each bit of code in the report generation section

          

          Test procedures



          The reports server subcomponents generate HTML from a query string.  A simple web page be written, with several different types of queries created to give complete code coverage.  When each link is clicked at test will be done.  The reports will be outputted to several HTML files, and visually examined for correctness.  Additionally, invalid queries will be sent to make sure an error is sent



          The attempted queries will be as follows:



              A query to retrieve a detailed view of all the gangs, and minor view of the players (2*/1*/0*)

  

              B query to retrieve a detailed view of all the players in a gang with a list of their cars (0[gangname]/2*/1*)



              C query to retrieve a detailed view of all the cars of a specific player (2[gangname]/1[playername]/2*0



              D query to retrieve a list of gangs in light mode  (1*/0*/0*)

 

              E query to retrieve all the cars in the game (0*/0*/2*) 



         

          Test 34B Server startup



            Requirements:

               5.3, 5.3.1,



            Method: 

               

                Black box testing will be used.  Either the server has started or it hasn't :)



            Test procedure:



                The command to run the reports server will be called, and then a web browser will be used to test to see if it responds.





         

          Test 34C Server shutdown



            Requirements:

                5.3, 5.3.2,

                Black box testing will be used.  Either the server has stopped or it hasn't :)



            Test procedure:



                The command to stop the reports server will be called, and then a web browser will be used to test to see if it responds.
