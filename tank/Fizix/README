this dir contains the physics engine portion of my animation library that i'll 
probably be doing my masters thesis on.


issues
- we have body.h, what about particle.h.  would like them to share as much 
  code as possible but still be very fast.
  
- what about data attached to each body/particle.  we dont want to embed
  every possible data item (color, age, texture, etc...), but yet we need
  the capability to do this at will... template metaprogramming, data fields?
  
- collision.  non existant.  need some way to do this.  
  1.) need generic hooks for collision in the pengine
    a.) should consider temporal
  2.) need collision library, geometry structure for efficient collisions.
