this dir contains the physics engine portion of my animation library that i'll 
probably be doing my masters thesis on.


issues
- particle.h is simply a subset of body.h, nothing more.
  would like them to share as much code as possible but still be very fast.
  
- what about data attached to each body/particle.  we dont want to embed
  every possible data item (color, age, texture, etc...), but yet we need
  the capability to do this at will... template metaprogramming, data fields?
  
- collision.  non existant.  need some way to do this.  
  1.) need generic hooks for collision in the dynengine
    a.) should consider temporal
  2.) need collision library, geometry structure for efficient collisions.
