# Basic clean-up file.  This defines a 'clean' target that pretty much every
# application developer would find useful.  It removes the objects files
# (listed in $(OBJS)) as well as any core files and user-specified junk files.
# A 'clobber' target is also defined that runs 'clean' and then removes the
# application binary (whose name is set in $(APP_NAME)).

# CLEAN_DIRS    - The list of extra directories that can be removed when the
#                'clean' target is run.
# CLOBBER_FILES - The list of extra files that should be removed when the
#                'clobber' target is run.
