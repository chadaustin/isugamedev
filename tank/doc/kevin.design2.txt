=================
it's like breakout, but it's first person like quake, and you are   
bouncing the ball against walls of rooms trying to get through this maze  
of rooms.  so imagine a long corridor (like the breakout or arackenoid    
game) but it's 3D and the bricks are not above you, but in front of you.
then you've got to throw the ball handball style at the wall and ping pong
it back and forth with your paddle until the bricks break away allowing   
you to move forward onwards through the corridor and deeper into the 
dungeons/labyrinth/etc...  of course there would be prizes and such, maybe 
some rooms would have ramps to bowl the ball off of.
