=============================
Kevin Meinert - (inititial design concept)

Name
=========
dreamgame (better name to be decided)

Genre
=========
highlevel description: hard core action adventure
detail description: cross genre - (RPG, puzzle, and
                                   arcade action combined)


Similar to other games?
========================
DreamGame takes ideas from many places:
- ankh (triggerable objects, puzzles, remote control room)
- zelda (market places you can buy and sell at)
- blaster master (tank, and person that can get out, weapons powerup)
- super mario (jumpsquash, size powerups (in this game size wont change))
- mario 64 (3rd person camera action)
- return to krondor, diablo (inventory screen, equip your character)
- lode runner (digging to trap enemies)
- duke nukem (tripwire, pipebomb)
- all rpg games (player stats)

basically zelda adventure, blastermaster action, and ankh puzzles.
(note: for ankh, go check out an appleIIe emulator and get ankh.bin      
       file for it :)

Objective
==========
Immediate: Get to the end of each level
Overall: Rescue the ancient time crystal (or something like that).


Why this game is fun
====================
player needs to be clever (puzzles!), lots of weapons, powerups, character 
building, RPG, puzzle, and arcade action combined


Target audience
================
should appeal to casual to midlevel gamer. hard core gamers might be annoyed 
it isn't a full RPG, but well, it isn't.  The game will start out easy
so anyone can play, and get progressivly harder.


Gameplay
==========
The game is structured in large levels (like ankh, zelda, blaster master).
Your character is a futuristic hovercraft, or a person.
There is a puzzle element (like pressing a button opens a door two rooms 
over), and enemies that block your way.  kill enemies with weapons you find
along the way, ammo is limited also so you need to find that too.  very seldom
you will also find a storefront where you can trade sell or buy.  your life is
limited by your health, and you have only one life.  saving is done with
powercrystals found at checkpoints along the game.  you are allowed a save 
at exit as well.  you can accumulate wealth.  every x amount of wealth gives 
you some health.  You can find health powerups too.  There will be some places
that your character can't go (because a halway is too narrow etc..) so
you will have to get out of your ship.  The ship and the player can be 
upgraded in terms of ship body, and player armor.  read on for more 
detail....


brainstorm features (sorry no time to write this up! :)
========================================================
- vehicle and avatar mode
- powerups (for ship and avatar)
  - for vehicle weapons, and avatar weapons
  - health, speed, armor, etc..
  - treasure (different values of jewels spread everywhere like in Spiro)
  - avatar can't carry ship powerups
  - ship can't carry avatar powerups
- "get out of your vehicle" mode
  - there will be narrow areas that require this
  - there are a different class of weapons powerups for this mode
- Jump for both vehicle and avatar
- puzzles
  - remote control
- RPG stats (for ship and avatar)
  - speed 
  - aiming
  - armor
  - hand to hand combat
- bonus levels
- random thoughts
  - some enemies you can't squish
  - some you can't bury
  - some you can't shoot with certain weapons
- weapons
  - hot keys (like quake 1-9 and 0)
  - dig holes (like loderunner)
  - jumpsquash (supermario style)
  - traditional
    - rocket ...................(best)
    - railgun
    - chaingun (plasma?)
    - plasma ...................(worst)
- singleplayer with option for mplayer (pretty much singleplayer game)
- inventory screen
  - arrange picked up items.
  - specify what parts of ship has armor, weapons
  - covers entire view (to simulate not paying attention when arranging)
  - does not stop gameplay! :)
- triggered items
  - some remote control weapon (box that shoots, like in ankh)
    - the remote control can be picked up separately of course. :)
  - timed door who's trigger is in another room 
    (thus you'd have to use the remote control 
     weapon to push the button for you)
- savegame
  - save crystals found at every checkpoint give you the opportunity 
    to save them up and choose when they are used.
  - save is allowed at game exit (we're not cruel)
  - cheat mode gives a quick save anytime, but you don't get treasure.
  - consider this... quicksave available everywhere except for in areas 
    near the end of the level.
- lives
  - just one (like diablo ii)
  - you have a health meter (power ups will be available)
- vehicles
  - after certain "special" enemies are killed, you can repair their ship
    - and use it.
  - issue... how to repair the ship?
    - avatar carries a repair kit found in special avatar areas of the map
  - need to switch vehicles
    - new tank allows you to jump higher to a place you need to get to
    - more inventory but slower ship (or less and faster)
    - tank weapons can't transfer (cause the avatar can't carry them!)
- camera (like mario64)
- enemies
  - when you learn the puzzles, the this can give the game replay
  - makes the game more fun, harder when puzzles are easy.
  - some can be buried, some jumpsquashed.  most can be shot, but not some. :)
  

TODO: break all this stuff out into chapters.  should make a nice 50
page doc when done. :)
