Name
=========
aki's quest

Genre
=========
hard core action adventure

detail description: cross genre - (elements of RPG, puzzle, and
                                   arcade action combined)


Similar to other games?
========================
DreamGame takes ideas from many places:
- ankh (triggerable objects, puzzles, remote control room)
- zelda (market places you can buy and sell at)
- blaster master (tank, and person that can get out, weapons powerup)
- super mario (jumpsquash, size powerups (in this game size wont change))
- mario 64 (3rd person camera action)
- return to krondor, diablo (inventory screen, equip your character)
- lode runner (digging to trap enemies)
- duke nukem (tripwire, pipebomb)
- all rpg games (player stats)

basically zelda adventure, blastermaster action, ankh puzzles, with quake 
weaponry.

(note: what's ankh??  go download out an AppleIIe emulator and get ankh.bin      
       file for it :)

Objective
==========
Immediate: Get to the end of each level
Overall: Rescue the ancient time crystal (or something like that).


Why this game is fun
====================
player needs to be clever (puzzles!), lots of weapons, powerups, character 
building, RPG, puzzle, and arcade action combined

ancient civilization + lots of technology + a little magic
(tech = mechanical, electricity, atomic)


Target audience
================
should appeal to casual to midlevel gamer. hard core gamers might be annoyed 
it isn't a full RPG, but well, it isn't.  The game will start out easy
so anyone can play, and get progressivly harder.


Gameplay in General
====================
Main character is 5 year old girl named Aki.  Aki is a normal girl who 
unwittingly gets thrown into several quests which promise to lead to her
back home.  With the help of some high tech vehicles and heavy weapons she 
becomes a powerful adventurer.

You control Aki, or one of her vehicles depending on where they are needed 
in the game.

Each world has designed adventure/quests and major puzzles.
Arcade action along the way just to survive, and to gain wealth.

The game is structured in large levels (like ankh, zelda, blaster master).
There is a puzzle element (like pressing a button opens a door two rooms 
over), and enemies that block your way.  kill enemies with weapons you find
along the way, ammo is limited also so you need to find that too.  very seldom
you will also find a storefront where you can trade sell or buy.  your life is
limited by your health, and you have only one life.  saving is done with
powercrystals found at checkpoints along the game.  you are allowed a save 
at exit as well.  you can accumulate wealth.  every x amount of wealth gives 
you some health.  You can find health powerups too.  There will be some places
that your character can't go (because a halway is too narrow etc..) so
you will have to get out of your ship.  The ship and the player can be 
upgraded in terms of ship body, and player armor.  

Caves are usually how you travel in this game.  Caves are accessable from 
the surface, sometimes a cave will lead to the surface of a different land. 
Some caves are short and simply there to get you somewhere else, other caves 
are actual adventures.

read on for more detail....



Our story So Far
=================
Main character is 5 year old girl named Aki.  Aki is a normal girl, likes to 
play etc...  One night she wakes up to the sound of knocking at her closet.
Fearless, she gets up to investigate and discovers that there is a cool wind 
coming from under the door.  Throwing it open she climbs in and emerges into
a rocky cavernlike tunnel.  The door slams shut behind her and she is unable
to open it.  Slightly annoyed, but still curious about the cave, she plods
on.  After a while a gentle breeze blows and on it floats dozens of 
luminescent insects. Intrigued, she follows them until they exit the cave...

village of atla (theme is ancient mayan)
===========================================
Outside there is a marketplace.  Unsure what to do, Aki tries to blend in
and checks out several of the stalls.  One of them houses a strange mystic
that upon seeing her invites her to come in and talk.  Asking him questions
teaches her much about her new world.  Strangely he knows about her entrance
from the closet, and informs her that she will not be able to get back
because there is a force holding it closed.  To disable the force will require
some research and aquisition of powers the mystic can not provide.  Thus
he suggests that she explore the land and see what she can find.

throughout the market are hidden powerups, so exploring here is a good thing.

NOTEs: she doesn't find her vehicle until later, inner and outer atla she is 
walking and building her character Zelda 64 style.

outer atla (jungle with clearings)
===================================
Here powerups are found in organic containers:  mushroom stools, on enemies,  
etc...  Also found in plain view: floating items, gems. 
<expand on this, gameplay, enemies, puzzles, etc...>
Hidden is an entrance to the subterrainian world.


subterrain atla (rocky + technology)
=======================
lots of loderunner and mario action (ledges, weapon/item/wealth powerups, 
enemies).  Here is where she vinds a vehicle, appanently it was being stored
by some techomancer...  To find it she solved 3 puzzles involving locks.
The locks are not standard locks, but must be cleverly triggered.  Inspection 
of the world are all the hints she has.

1st puzzle
-----------
10 rooms.
press wall plates in a long winding corridor.  The number above the plate
opens the door with that number.  you as a player need to notice that the 
numbers may be connected with each other.

2nd puzzle
-----------
she finds a key that emits a short tune.  match this to the door that 
emits the same tune.

3rd puzzle
-----------
she finds a new kind of object that when "used" it emits a burst of energy
(or bullet)...  The burst always exits from the same direction (world aligned)
no matter how she drops the item on the ground.  She can "use" it while it
is on the ground, or while it is in her inventory.  Shooting it with a weapon
will redirect the burst in the object's direction as well (only with certain 
gun).  There will be a timed door that when triggered will close again after 
2 seconds.  Unfortunately for Aki the trigger is just too far away.  She 
must place the shooting object near the trigger and shoot at it while standing 
near the door.


The vehicle is too big to fit through the way she came, and must exit out a 
larger tunnel, which leads her to a new world....  Plans on the walls of this
cave showed that the vehicle is a prototype design.  The plans illustrate
the vehicle's advanced capabilities.  currently, the vehicle can do the normal 
driving plus straef and jump.  she soon notices that the vehicle is upgradable 
when she finds a simple weapon for it (drive over it to pick it up).

NOTE: the addition of the vehicle adds the need to find power for it.  If the
vehicle power runs out, then Aki's health meter is displayed, but will probably 
run out fast if against a vehicle-strength enemy...  If vehicle power becomes 
too low, it will sink to the ground unable to move.  Aki is able to get out and
find vehicle power cells or repair kits.




Other Levels
============
describe some levels here.  going into details about the puzzles and
strategy in each part.  describe items and enemies too.  give sketches
or pictures of the map for each level (concept or fully planned)...   

I want at least 3 of the levels themed to each of the fillowing,
- Mayan villages, african/mayan jungle  (atla)
- nile river valley
- ancient crete



Enumerate Game Objects
========================

personal items
---------------
- invisible power up, mad visible by some external trigger
- bullet shooting box triggered by some external trigger
- box that catches gunfire and redirects to one direction (world aligned)
  (only certain bullet types though.)
- triggerbox that when "use"d generated a trigger event
  this will be hooked up to an item that receives external events.


world items (can't pick them up)
----------------
- box that emits a personal item. (usually out its top)
  triggered when you try to "use" this item.
  (triggered when you bump it too?)
- Panel that when "use"d generates a trigger event.  
  This can be hooked up to a receiving (personal or world) item.

Timeline (milestones)
====================
hmmm...  probably will take a while.


Budget
====================
$0 (just time cause we're all free!)


brainstorm features (sorry no time to write this up! :)
========================================================
- vehicle and aki mode (i.e. she can get in and out of the vehicle)
- powerups (for ship and aki)
  - for vehicle weapons, and aki weapons
  - health, speed, armor, etc..
  - treasure (different values of jewels spread everywhere like in Spiro)
  - aki can't carry ship powerups
  - ship can't carry aki powerups
- "get out of your vehicle" mode
  - there will be narrow areas that require this
  - there are a different class of weapons powerups for this mode
- Jump for both vehicle and aki
- puzzles
  - remote control
- RPG stats (for ship and aki)
  - speed 
  - aiming
  - armor
  - hand to hand combat
- bonus levels
- random thoughts
  - some enemies you can't squish
  - some you can't bury
  - some you can't shoot with certain weapons
- weapons
  - hot keys (like quake 1-9 and 0)
  - dig holes (like loderunner)
  - jumpsquash (supermario style)
  - traditional
    - rocket ...................(best)
    - railgun
    - chaingun (plasma?)
    - plasma ...................(worst)
- singleplayer with option for mplayer (pretty much singleplayer game)
- inventory screen
  - arrange picked up items.
  - specify what parts of ship has armor, weapons
  - covers entire view (to simulate not paying attention when arranging)
  - does not stop gameplay! :)
- triggered items
  - some remote control weapon (box that shoots, like in ankh)
    - the remote control can be picked up separately of course. :)
  - timed door who's trigger is in another room 
    (thus you'd have to use the remote control 
     weapon to push the button for you)
- savegame
  - save crystals found at every checkpoint give you the opportunity 
    to save them up and choose when they are used.
  - save is allowed at game exit (we're not cruel)
  - cheat mode gives a quick save anytime, but you don't get treasure.
  - consider this... quicksave available everywhere except for in areas 
    near the end of the level.
- lives
  - just one (like diablo ii)
  - you have a health meter (power ups will be available)
- vehicles
  - after certain "special" enemies are killed, you can repair their ship
    - and use it.
  - issue... how to repair the ship?
    - aki carries a repair kit found in special aki-only areas of the map
  - need to switch vehicles
    - new tank allows you to jump higher to a place you need to get to
    - more inventory but slower ship (or less and faster)
    - tank weapons can't transfer (cause the aki can't carry them!)
- camera (like mario64)
- enemies
  - when you learn the puzzles, the this can give the game replay
  - makes the game more fun, harder when puzzles are easy.
  - some can be buried, some jumpsquashed.  most can be shot, but not some. :)
  

TODO: break all this stuff out into chapters.  should make a nice 50
page doc when done. :)
