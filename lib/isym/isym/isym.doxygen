 *  @section Intro Introducing Isym
 * Isym - extendable symbols for keyboard/mouse/joy/etc...
 * Isym is (C) Copyright 2002 by Kevin Meinert, Chad Austin, Ben Scott
 *
 *  @section Using Using This Reference Guide
 *  Welcome to Isym.  To use this reference guide effectively, we suggest 
 *  you see the <a href="namespaceisym.html">NamespaceList/isym</a> section first.
 *  The <a href="namespaceisym.html">NamespaceList/isym</a> section provides the most 
 *  intuitive navigation of the reference guide because this
 *  section is structured very similar to Isym.  Lastly, you should subscribe 
 *  to the mailing lists so that you can ask questions, or propose extensions 
 *  to the library.
 *
 *  @section Philosophy Philosophy
 *  The philosophy of isym is to create locally unique symbols for use in 
 *  input systems for virtual environments (games, vr, etc..).
 *  This symbol table should be extendable, meaning that 3rd party libs
 *  and applications should be able to add their own symbols to isym without
 *  recompiling isym.
 *
 *  @section Extendability Extendability
 *  Using the isym::getUID() function you can extend isym with your own unique IDs.
