2003-11-26 aegis        NEW VERSION: 0.3.1
2003-11-26 aegis        Added missing OpenGL.h to 'make dist' release
2003-08-04 aegis        NEW VERSION: 0.3.0
2003-03-18 aegis        Renamed FontStream to Stream and added the
                        GLTEXT_STREAM convenience macro.
2003-03-15 aegis        Added an fps example and made the renderers always
	                draw with the current position being the upper left
	                corner of the text.
2003-03-14 aegis        Added a MIPMAP font renderer that generates a full set
	                of mipmaps instead of just one, like TEXTURE does.
2003-02-25 aegis        Improved rendering by taking advantage of kerning.
2003-02-25 aegis        Added getHeight() to FontRenderer.
2003-02-25 aegis        Re-added getFont() to FontRenderer and added getDPI()
	                to Font.
2003-02-25 aegis        When rendering a \n, the FontRenderer now drops down
                        to the next line, rather than trying to draw the glyph
                        for \n.
2003-02-13 aegis        Fixed the texture renderer to actually use alpha
                        blending and added an alpha example.
2003-02-13 aegis        OpenFont takes an optional dpi argument now.
2003-02-07 aegis        Renamed CreateFont to OpenFont
2003-02-03 aegis        Modified internal structure slightly so that
                        custom Font and Glyph implementations will work.
                        Greatly reduced footprint by removing the few uses
	                of iostream from the gltext library itself.  Got
	                rid of exceptions as well.
	                FontRenderers now take a Font as an argument.  Got
                        rid of the SetFont method.
                        Cache GLGlyph objects in the FontRenderer so all
	                render() calls reuse glyphs.
			Implemented the TEXTURE renderer.
			Made method calls use the __stdcall calling
	                convention on Windows so they are compatible with
	                COM.
			Moved OpenGL includes into OpenGL.h to factor out
	                Windows-specific and future MacOS X-specific
	                include logic.
			Removed the FTLibrary singleton class (each font
	                allocates an FT_Library object now) because of
	                potential thread safety problems in the C6.
			Got rid of FontStyle because it was never used
	                (and most fonts use one file per style).
			New iostream-compatible and DLL compatible
	                streaming API.
