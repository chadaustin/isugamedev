This is a very simple introduction to the easy to use GLText API.

1.
Make sure you include the gltext header.

   #include <gltext.h>

2.
First you'll need to open a font. The font describes how each character
looks to the renderer. You need to specify:
   - the name of the file that contains the font definition
   - the point size of the font you want
If the creation fails, OpenFont will return NULL.

   gltext::FontPtr myFont(gltext::OpenFont("arial.ttf", 24));

3.  Create a renderer for the font. The renderer is responsible for
making the OpenGL calls necessary to draw the text you want on the
screen. You must tell GLText what type of renderer you want and what
font it should render. If the creation fails, CreateRenderer will
return NULL.

   gltext::RendererPtr myRenderer(gltext::CreateRenderer(
      gltext::PIXMAP, myFont));

4.
Tell the renderer which font you want to use when it draws your text to the
screen.

5.
Set up the OpenGL MODELVIEW matrix to place the font on the screen and ask the
renderer to show off its tough stuff. Note that the renderer will use the
current OpenGL color to draw the text.

   glMatrixMode(GL_MODELVIEW);
   glTranslatef(100, 100, 100);
   glColor4f(1, 1, 1, 0.5f);
   GLTEXT_STREAM(myRenderer) << "hello world in the year " << 2002;

6.  When you're done, make sure you delete your fonts and renderers.
The smart pointers will take care of this in most cases for you.

That's it! Look in gltext.h for descriptions of the remaining functions.
