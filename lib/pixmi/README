Description:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Like a pigmi, pixmi is small, and should stay that way.  It is designed
with graphics APIs such as OpenGL in mind, and the data loaded into the 
pixmi::Image object should be formated for the way OpenGL wants to receive it.

Image formats supported are
- PNG 
- PCX
- BMP
- TGA
- SGI

pixmi compiles under every platform (tested under win32, linux, irix, 
probably others)

pixmi philosophy is to proivide an intuitive C++ interface to load and save
images, and maintain a small footprint and minimal dependencies.

Requirements:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This project has the following dependencies:
  Your compiler should support STL. 
  - http://www.sgi.com/Technology/STL
  zlib
  - included here for your convenience...

=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Usage:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
everything is in the pixmi namespace.  

   Loading an image is easy:
     pixmi::TgaImporter i;
     pixmi::Image image;
     i.load( "filename.tga", image );

   then to access the data (to pass to OpenGL for example):
     void *data = image.data()
     int width = image.width();
     int height = image.height();
     int channels = image.channels();
     int bpp = image.bpp();
     // then call your opengl funcs with the params 
     // to load the image into your graphics hardware.

Building the Source:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
This should "make" on any system, but you may have to type gmake on some.
The examples are created for you, and dumped in the root of this project.

Sorry, no lib is made, and no vc++ project is available at this time.  
bug the author (please) for this and other feature requests.

TODO:
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
o generate a library...
o split this makefile into the proper subdirs
o use configure.in for compile opts... (why???  make can do most of it)
  o because we'd like to configure where zlib is (and other libs)
o make vc++ files...
