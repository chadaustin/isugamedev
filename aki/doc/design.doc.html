<h1>SIMILAR TO OTHER GAMES?</h1>
aki's quest takes ideas from many places:
<ul>
   <li> blaster master (tank, and person that can get out, weapons powerup)
   <li> ankh (triggerable objects, puzzles, remote control room)
   <li>quake (heavy weapons, rocket, grenade, railgun, nailgun)
   <li>zelda (market places you can buy and sell at)
   <li>super mario (jumpsquash, size powerups (in this game size wont change))
   <li>mario 64 (3rd person camera action)
   <li>return to krondor, diablo (inventory screen, equip your character)
   <li>lode runner (digging to trap enemies)
   <li>duke nukem (tripwire, pipebomb)
   <li>all rpg games (player stats)
</ul>

<p>
basically blastermaster exploration, ankh 
puzzles/<a href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/ankh/ankhmap.txt">philosophy</a>, 
quake weaponry, with zelda adventure, and mario/zelda fantasy.

<p>
(note: <a href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/ankh/ankhmap.txt">what's 
ankh</a>, what's it <a href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/ankh/ankhmap.jpg">look like</a>??  go download an <a href="ftp://ftp.apple.asimov.net/pub/apple_II/emulators/applewin/">AppleIIe emulator</a> 
and get <a href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/ankh/ankh.dsk">ankh.dsk</a>      
file for it :)

<h1>OBJECTIVE</h1>
<p>
general: Save the universe while trying to get back home.
specific:  Solve a series of puzzles using scientific method to advance in the
game.  Using <a target="newwindow" href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/aki.chaingun.snapshot.jpg">heavy</a> <a
target="newwindow" href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/aki.rocketlauncher.snapshot.jpg">weapons</a>, defeating
any enemy that gets in the way of the adventure.  Find and gather clues about getting your home portal to open
again, and possibly save the universe



<h1>WHY THIS GAME IS FUN</h1>
<a
target="newwindow" href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/tankincave.big.jpg">
<img  border="0" width="320" height="240" src="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/tankincave.jpg">
</a>

<p>
player needs to be clever (puzzles!), lots of weapons,
powerups, character 
building, RPG, puzzle, and arcade action combined

<p>
throughout, the player achievs a feeling of discovery (very
important)<BR>  the player can express themselvs in many ways at
once or one at a time <BR>
<ul>
<li> engineering/problemsolving
<li> skill/weaponry
<li> budgeting of wealth and powerups.
</ul>

<p>
This game will also appeal to those who enjoy
ancient civilization + technology + magic
(tech = mechanical, electricity, atomic)


<h1>TARGET AUDIENCE</h1>
<p>
people who like puzzles with a mechanical/scientific slant combined with 
adventure with plenty of action complimented by an intelligent reason for
playing (not stupid/weak like "save the princess").  The game will start out 
easy so anyone can play, and get progressivly harder.


<h1>some random philosophy (TODO: move this section elsewhere)</h1>
<p>
well...  similar to metroid, zelda, blaster master etc...  there were tons   
of areas or "levels", but they do end at some point, and there is a weak story 
line.  levels are continuous, and able to be reentered from beginning or end.
for example, Aki could return to the first village in the game to pick up 
more supplies if needed...

<p>
The primary focus in this game is the puzzles.  puzzles run the universe, and 
is how to release energy and reveal paths.  puzzles are mechanical in nature, 
and require the scientific method to solve.

<p>
Story.  Very behind the scenes, but is a driving force.  More story than super 
mario (not just dumb save the princess)...
player should feel compelled to play because their imagination tells them
that playing is important and that they are making some great change in the 
world.  they are learning from the puzzles, and enjoy the challenge, and like
how the plot twists itself into this puzzle game.
but the story is still secondary.  So basically, there should be a 
great story, not just some dumb "save the princess" like mario had.
But it is important to note that this story is _behind_ the action 
(the gameplay is similar to mario and ankh).  


<h1><a name="gameplay">GAMEPLAY IN GENERAL</h1>

<h2>character</h2>
<ul>
<p>
All realtime 3rd person character control, like mario 64, zelda 64.
This game is not turnbased! (your character always has freedom of movement 
and actions).

<p>
Main character is a girl named Aki.  Aki is a normal girl who 
unwittingly gets thrown into a quest.  With the help of some high tech 
vehicles and <a target="newwindow" href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/aki.chaingun.snapshot.jpg">heavy</a> <a
target="newwindow" href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/aki.rocketlauncher.snapshot.jpg">weapons</a>
she can really kick some ass (secondary action).  

<p>
You control Aki, or one of her vehicles depending on where they are needed 
in the game.  And sometimes you use Aki to press buttons on a control panel 
to control some other thing (like a robot)...
</ul>

<h2>puzzles</h2>
<ul>
<p>
Along the way are several intriguing puzzles (primary action) designed to 
make the player think.  Each world has is designed for exploration and the 
puzzles it contains.  No bosses.  There are major and minor puzzles.  
There are enemies along the way to slow you down or kill you (and excuse to 
play with some impressivly flashy weaponry - rocket launchers, plasma, etc...).
Friendly NPCs and Solving puzzles can give you small clues about your 
mysterious quest.   Killing enemies can give you wealth.  

<p>
Puzzles are located <a
target="newwindow" href="http://www.vrac.iastate.edu/~kevn/cave1.big.jpg">below ground</a>.  This is because below ground is a 
tricky place created from the energy that connects all worlds.  To navigate
through this subterrania, you must get through puzzles.
To solve the puzzles you use scientific method (see puzzle solving guide).
If player gets stuck there will be an oracle hidden above ground.  There
will/may be clues to help the player find this oracle above ground or below.
The oracle is not nessesarily a person though.  It doesn't give a direct answer.
Using some animated geometry it will show you something intended to spark your
imagination as to how to solve the puzzle.  Similarly there will be a map room
hidden in each above land area to show you (with images) where you've been.

<p>
The game is structured in medium size levels (like ankh, zelda, blaster master).
There is a mechanical/lego/engineering puzzle element.  Objects will have 
many facets ("use" makes a sound, while shooting it redirects the bullet).
and there are enemies to block your way.  Kill enemies with weapons you find
along the way, ammo is limited also so you need to find that too.  very seldom
you will also find a storefront where you can trade sell or buy.  your life is
limited by your health, and you have only one life.  saving is done with
powercrystals found at checkpoints along the game.  you are allowed a save 
at exit as well.  you can accumulate wealth.  every x amount of wealth gives 
you some health.  You can find health powerups too.  There will be some places
that your character can't go (because a halway is too narrow etc..) so
you will have to get out of your ship.  The ship and the player can be 
upgraded in terms of ship body, and player armor.
</ul>

<p>
there are aboveground and belowground areas.  Aboveground are individual worlds
all with different culture, but with some similar ideas (organic, ancient civ, 
with technology).  Colors here are mainly green, brown, white...
Belowground is all made from the same "fabric", so will all look very similar.
There are a few themes characterized by how deep each below ground is.
It's all cave-like, rocks and crystals, rooms, chambers, and platforms.
Colors here are mainly blue, purple, or red (cave wall rock color for example).
</ul>
<h2>travel</h2>
<ul>
<p>
Transitions between above and below happen by driving/walking your character
into a cave, hole, stairs, ladder, or pipe...  These portals are accessable
from hidden and plain sight locations.  Not all caves have anything in them,
not all have exits (maybe just an entrance), some have series of puzzles and
have exits to other above-land worlds.  All cave exits go above ground.
</P>
</ul>

<h1><a name="premise">STORY / PREMISE</h1>

<P>
The world of Aki's Quest is balanced by two eternally opposing forces:  the good and the evil.  (Names need to be made for the forces)  The
good side governs the above ground, and the evil side governs the below ground area.  Both sides are necessary for the planet's survival, 
and each side is necessary for the existance of the other (Without the good side, the evil side couldn't exist, and vice versa), the below 
ground areas are connected with the above ground areas, but the good priests cannot go below ground, and the evil priests cannot travel 
above ground.  The good and the evil have been at war with each other ever since the beginning of the planet's existance.  
</P>
<P>We haven't decided upon how to implement the "powers" of both the good and evil forces.  The different alternatives are discussed 
below.)
</P>

<h3>Elemental System</h3>
<P>
They fight each other using the elements native to the planet; to strengthen their magical powers, they must develop the natural setting of the
planet into something complicated.  (Make one tree a forest, make an empty desert have an oasis, etc. for good, and evil must make a cave 
an underground maze, change a simple tunnel into a three mile passageway, and so on).  Because they must develop their powers through 
this process, the war has caused the creation and development of all terrain, landscape, and life (excluding the humans) on both the above 
ground and below ground areas.
By developing this landscape, the good side obtains the following elements:
<ul>
<li>Light</li>
<li>Fire</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Wind</li>
<li>Green (life of trees, grass, etc)</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
By developing the subterranean, the evil side obtains the following elements:
<ul>
<li>Shadow</li>
<li>Flare</li>
<li>Water</li>
<li>Earth</li>
<li>Miasma</li>
</ul>
</P>
<P>
For thousands of years the two sides have battled to a stalemate, and the balance of the planet was maintained.  Priests of the evil were born
to their elements, and priests of the good were born to theirs as well.  Both orders did not realize that they were connected through two of the
elements (flare connects to fire, and water connects to water).
</P>
<P>
Until, a man born of shadow, flare, and water met a woman born of light, fire, and water.  The shadow made the man into a sinister sort of 
attractiveness (jet black/blue hair, dark eyes, grey skin, but muscular figure, etc.)  The flare gave the man's inner passions strength, and the
water made him cool, calm, and composed on the outside.
</P>
<P>
The light made the woman look like a golden haird celestial being; the fire made her impulsive, temperamental, and passionate about 
everything.  The water served to keep a rein on her inner thoughts, making her personality very flexible and adaptable to any situation 
(In other words, she wouldn't panic on the inside).  
</P>
<P>
The man was a genius, and consequently, the most powerful evil priest to be born.  He was very eccentric, and defied what he refered to as 
the "traditional" way of doing things.  Because of this, he was isolated from any of his peers, and spent most of his time exploring/developing
his power in different ways.  This is how he discovered the link in the elements.  He used that link to view the world above ground, and 
eventually, he came upon the woman.
</P>
<P>  
The man and the woman met, and the flare fed the man's infatuation with her beauty, and the fire fed the woman's impulses.  The man 
couldn't resist the belief that she was the most beautiful woman and was just for him, and the woman couldn't resist her impulse to pursue 
the man.  
</P>
<h3>Engineering System</h3>
<P>
Instead of magic, the two opposing factions are separated in a modernity vs. romantic lifestyle clash.  The good priests lead lives that 
resemble those of Far Eastern monks.  They derive their power through meditation and the development of the mind and body.  Their
architecture also reflects this lifestyle; the buildings will resemble Turkey in the late 1500's, or Japan in the 1500's, or the traditional Chinese
architecture, or the traditional Native American architecture (Mayans, Incans, etc.), and perhaps the fantastic architecture of the elves.  The
good priests' power should also include the ability to tap into thought and action through a spoken word.  These words are from an ancient
language that is the binary language of all thought  (~cough cough~ <U>Snow Crash</U> ~cough cough~).  
</P>
<P>
The evil priests represent the modernity half of this clash, and they are completely technological.  Their underground cities contain 
completely futuristic technology, and they have a utopian style of architecture.  Huge buildings, domes, and lots of little robot helpers.  Large
intricate tracks and tunnels for futuristic vehicles, etc.  Their weaponry is futuristic as well; beam guns, electron weaponry, etc.  The priests
themselves are more scientists than priests.  The entire culture of the underground revolves around science, research and development.
</P>
<h3>General Outline of Past</h3>
<P>
Over the next year and a half, they courted, fell in love, married in secret (defying both orders and the balance of the planet), and had one 
child:  a girl.  The side of the man's family (those from the shadow element), found out, and they followed him one day to the above ground
using the same bridge through flare and water that allowed him to meet the woman.  Once above ground, the man's family immediately
attacked the good priesthood using both the evil elements, and the two good elements (fire and water).  The good priesthood, still unaware of 
the bridge between fire and water (and thus unable to draw upon it's power) were unable to push them back. 
</P>
<P>
The woman, unaware of the man's innocence, thought her husband had betrayed her, and fled with the girl (who was still a baby).  The 
woman, knowing of the bridge between fire and water, used light to hide herself and the child.
</P>
<P>
The man, refusing to aid his relatives in their conquest, instead searched for the woman during the war to try and explain things, 
but he was unable to locate her (due to the woman using light).
</P>
<P>
After several years of battle, the good priesthood was defeated and enslaved by the evil priesthood.  The evil priesthood drew upon their 
powers and sealed the good priesthood below ground by creating intricate and complicated structures the likes of which had never been 
seen before.  (Enter the puzzles.)  
</P>
<P>
The woman, had literally drained all of her life energy by running and hiding both her and the child throughout the duration of the war.  She 
staggered into a village (or whatever; this should be the place Aki starts out in the game) one night while the girl was sleeping; she left the 
child at someone's doorstep (haven't decided who) and walked into a lake near the village in order to perish without her body being 
discovered postmortem.  
</P>
<P>
The man, finally gave up his search for his wife and child at the end of the war.  Realizing what his family had done to the good priesthood, 
he used slightly manipulated the puzzles to allow for one of the good priest's to be freed without being noticed:  His father-in-law.  He 
entrusted his father-in-law with the tast of searching for the girl so that she could free the priests by destroying the puzzles, and restore the 
balance to the universe.  
</P>
<h5>Possible Cutscene</h5>
<P>
"Her birthright is the key; she has the power of both light and darkness" said the evil man.  "You must find her, so that she can restore this 
planet to it's rightful state.  This is my price for freeing you from enslavement."
</P>
<P>
The good priest nods, "Of course, I shall search for the rest of my days if necessary, but I WILL find her.  What will you do?"
</P>
<P>
The evil priest laughed haughtily, "I go to allow my daughter a chance at vengeance.  I will modify the bridge of the elements and the 
puzzles so that there is a key to OUR dimension."
</P>
<P>
"Such a thing is inconceivable!" the good priest exclaimed, "No one has such power!"
</P>
<P>
The evil priest smirked, "Unless of course, one were to draw upon their life energy and seal the bridge with his blood."
</P>
<P>
"Whaaaat!"
</P>
<P>
"Farewell, good priest.  We shall not meet again."  The evil priest bowed.
</P>
<P>
Thus the man manipulated the puzzles and the bridge simultaneously creating a key to the evil priest's homeland and sealing off the invading
evil priest's from their homeland.  The price of such a feat was his life.
</P>
<P>
The evil priests, unable to return home, used their flare and water to disguise themselves as the good priesthood (who are actually enslaved)
to the rest of the world.  They then set out to finding a way to bridge the two worlds again, so that they might create one empire out of both 
dimensions.
</P>
<P>
The good priest disguised himself as an evil priest and joined their order so that he would be better equipped to find his granddaughter.  One
day, he hears that the evil priesthood has found a girl that might accomplish their goals, her name is Aki, and she is in a small village named
Solace...
</P>
<h3>General Flow of Plot</h3>
<P>
Aki has lived a normal childhood in the village of Solace.  Her parents found her at their doorstep one morning wrapped in a blanket.  She 
was but a young child then.  She's had a normal childhood in the small village (play with the dog, run around in the back yard, etc.)  She 
has no memory of her life before the village, and she does not know of any other parents other than those in the village.  As the game 
progresses, the player will learn more of Aki's past through flashbacks, stories told by different people, and written pieces in game.  She will 
first discover that she is NOT a normal girl, and gradually, she will learn of her parents and how they met.  This will continue until she learns
first of her mother's death.  Finally, she will learn about her father's sacrifice, and this will allow her to travel to the evil priests' domain.  
</P>

<!-- I believe we've answered these.  I'm leaving them in the comments for reference though.  Perhaps they should be left in the doc
itself, but placed elsewhere?
<p>
I'm going to brainstorm here.  anyone want to revise this into english?

<p>
lets answer these questions:
<ul>
<li>why are puzzles so important
<li>why is the below ground areas so infested with puzzles?
<li>who are these enemies that keep impeding our progress while we solve
  these puzzles?
<li>why do we need to quest in the first place? (this is sort of answered here
  already)
<li>why does belowground connect every above-land? (this is also sort already 
  answered)
<li>what is some history of this priesthood, and are they really good?
  <ul>
  <li>for half of the game, they are good, and aki is working for them
    diligently solving puzzles and blasting evil minions.
  <li>along the way we get faint, then stronger hints that they may not be evil
  <li>for the last half of the game we find out that they are actually evil
    and must be defeated.  we need to find a passage to their homeland (more
    puzzles and minions), and defeat them at their heart (which is below land
    and of course also has puzzles)...  defeating them causes the connecting
    energy between worlds to dissolve, and thus Aki has no way to get back,
    A prophet she met in the beginning of the game steps out and is of course
    a member of the real priesthood of which was enslaved somewhere.  He 
    reveals that in fact the energy is not destroyed, but is only shifted.
    He gives Aki a token that lets her see this other dimension, and thus access
    the alternate patchways.  Now Aki can travel back the way she came (this
    time through different below-ground paths).
  </ul>
<li>define the history of the "good" priesthood, and why don't we ever see them?
<li>think of ways to hint at this other priesthood in the game.  should be very
  fleeting (runes on the walls, and snippet of speech by a vendor).
</ul>  
-->    


<h1><a name="guides">PUZZLE DESIGNING GUIDE.</h1>

<p>
puzzles are solved using the scientific method:
<ul>
   <li>observe and examine and explore
   <li>collect facts from environment and from your inventory
   <li>apply these facts to the problem/puzzle at hand
</ul>

<b>Puzzles are never solved by chance</b>

<p>
Be clever, these puzzles should be logic based, make you
think, and make you appreciate it when you've solved it (i.e. it shouldn't
be obvious).  The puzzles can be imbedded into the map as well (below
ground generally) throughout 2 or more rooms, or small puzzles in just one
room.  Generally I think of puzzles as hunt/gather/apply - where you need
to find the pieces, then transport them to the problem area, then figure
out how to assemble them to solve the problem.  use your engineering
minds!

<p>
Most puzzles will require some object (key, block, crystal, mechanism, spring,
etc...)
<ul>
<li>materials should be interesting, for example:
  <ul>
  <li>audio upon [use] or when shot
  <li>redirection of bullet when shot
  <li>makes game objects appear or dissapear when held in inventory
  <li>increase size of inventory, when dropped will eject any items exceeding 
    your inventory
  </ul>
<li>through observation and experimentation (only) the player will learn the
  object capabilities and learn how to aplpy the tools to problems found
  throughout the game.
</ul>

<h1>WORLD DESIGNING GUIDE</h1>

<h2>World types</h2>
<ul>
<li>above ground
  <ul>
  <li>organic, ancient civ, with technology
  <li>green/brown/white
  <li>tech stuff has angles, minimal curves
  <li>organic stuff is very round (trees pots etc...)
  <li>architechture is a mixture of curve and straight depending on the world
  </ul>
<li>below ground
  <ul>
  <li>rocky, craggy, cavern, angles, crystals.
  <li>blue, purple, or red
  </ul>
</ul>

<h2>Transitions between worlds</h2>

<ul>
<h3>Always transition from above-land to below-land... or vice versa.</h3>
For example:

<pre>
    o
   /
- o -- o
   \    \
    o-o  o
     \
      o
</pre>

where:<BR>
<pre>
 o = "above" ground
 - = "below" ground
</pre>


Above-ground worlds are disconnected (just like an <i>island</i> is), the below-ground caves are what connect
them and is how you transition from world to world.

<p>
you begin below ground, and emerge above ground in the city of Atla.  from
there you can exit the city and explore some forest clearings/paths and
eventually find 1 of 3 possible exits.  each of these exits go somewhere
below ground.

<p>
The basic premise is that above leads to below, and below leads to above.
<b>only in very rare instances does above go to above</b> (like if you found a
secret transport device).

<h3>Aki will find a paths to below-land in the form of:</h3>
  <ul>
  <li>cave
  <li>stairs
  <li>pipe
  <li>hole (fall)
  <li>hole (ladder)
   </ul>

<h3>Some notes on designing these connections between worlds...</h3>

<p>
1.) the map can loop back on itself.  

<pre>
o--o
 \ |
  o--o
</pre>

Some Ideas:
 <ul>
 it would be cool if the loopback went to an above ground place you couldn't get to before

 for example, we have above-land #1, #2, #3, and #4:

 <pre>
 1--2
  \ |
   3--4
 </pre>

 <p>
 when you exit number 3 into the caves you'll have a choice of going to 2
 or to 4.  If you go to 2, then you'll come up into 2b.  an area that you
 saw while in 2, but couldn't quite get to before.

 <p>
 of course, you certainly are able to enter 2 from 2b, but maybe not
 viceversa.  Maybe only after you get the high-jump powerup (just for example) found in
 2b...
 </ul>

</ul>

<p>
<b>No bosses!</b>  Just puzzles and minor creatures stand in your way of travel.

Main character is a girl named Aki.  Aki is a normal girl, likes to 
play etc...  she is especially facinated with toy guns and rocket launchers, 
and spends many hours in the back yard with her dog.

<p>
One night she wakes up to the sound of scratching at her closet.
Fearless, she gets up to investigate and discovers that there is a cool wind 
coming from under the door.  Throwing it open she climbs in and emerges into
a rocky cavernlike tunnel.  The door slams shut behind her and she is unable
to open it.  
</P>
<P>
An old man steps out of the shadows and introduces himself as a good priest.  
He seems delighted to have found her.  He claims to need her help.
</P>
<p>"What for?"  Aki questions.</p>
<p>"The world around us is in trouble, Aki.  There is an evil underground that seeks
to conquer our land and its way of life.  We good priests are all that remain to guard this land."</p>
<h6>((Note:  The good priest is refraining from telling Aki of their enslavement.  He doesn't want to risk alerting the evil priests.))</h6>
<P>"How can I possibly help one of your kind with such a task?"</P>
<P>"Our power is waning Aki.  We can only use the simplest versions of what we used to be capable of.  We have tried to stop the evil
underground, but we are not strong enough.  Those that have gone below have not returned.  For years, we have searched for someone
with the ability to travel underground without aid.  Your entrance into this tunnel proves it; you ARE the chosen one."</P>
<P>"What do you mean?"  Aki asks, puzzled.  "This is just a tunnel below my house."</P>
<P>The old man smirks.  "It took me three days of meditation just to enter this particular tunnel.  I won't tell you how long it took me to actually
travel through it.  You, my dear, just accomplished such a feat in a matter of seconds."</P>
<P>Aki jumps back, astonished.  She was, however sympathetic, for he seemed like such a nice old man.  "What can I do to help?"</P>
<P>"I'm afraid all I can tell you is to explore the tunnels.  As no one who has gone below has actually returned, I cannot fathom what you will
encounter.  However, I might be able to arrange for some small aid."</P>
<h6>((Note:  He gives her the tank?))</H6>
<P>"All right, I will travel through the underground, but I still don't know if I can be of any help to you."</P>
<p>
Aki travels through the tunnel to the end, and emerges in the city of Atla.
</P>

<!--This sort of conflicted with what was above, but I didn't want to completely take it out.
It's sitting in the comments for now.  
<p>
The basic premise: a prophecy is about to be fulfilled.
In the universe, there is energy that connects every world.  Every 1000   
years this energy solidifies into actual passages that allow travel 
between worlds.  The guardians of these passages are an ancient secret
priesthood.  They of course know of this prophesy, and must see to it that
it is fulfilled.  They contact Aki, for she is the chosen one...

<p>
Main character is a girl named Aki.  Aki is a normal girl, likes to 
play etc...  she is especially facinated with toy guns and rocket launchers, 
and spends many hours in the back yard with her dog.

<p>
One night she wakes up to the sound of scratching at her closet.
Fearless, she gets up to investigate and discovers that there is a cool wind 
coming from under the door.  Throwing it open she climbs in and emerges into
a rocky cavernlike tunnel.  The door slams shut behind her and she is unable
to open it.  

<p>
clawed hands grab aki, around her are several birdlike figures in robes (like 
titanAE).  they introduce themselves as an ancient order bestowed with the 
task of preserving order and freedom to the universe.  they explain that 
there are several caves just like the one they are in that lead to other 
worlds.  A prophecy has foretold that someone from aki's world would restore 
order and stability.  "but why do you need me?  you seem to know a lot about 
this already..."  they explain that priests are not able to fight the evil 
that invade the interworld subterrainia because the evil force possess 
technology far too powerful (several mages have been defeated already it 
seems, the preisthood only possess a weak form of magic that allows them 
to read crystalballs and tealeaves and perform lesser magic such as healing 
and etc...)

<pre>
   [add in dialoge from the first paragraph of "our story so far"]
</pre>

<p>
the mages create a flock of luminescent insects and explain that they will guide aki
to the start of her adventure.  they wish her luck and cast the flock into the darkness. 
aki follows, and emerges from a secret door on the side of what appears to be a large 
ziggarraut...

-->
<p>
anyway, this is where the story picks up, and the gameplay begins.



<h1>VILLAGE OF ATLA (THEME IS ANCIENT MAYAN)</h1>
<p>
At the base of the ziggurat there is a marketplace.  Unsure what to do, Aki 
tries to blend in and checks out several of the stalls.  One of them houses 
a strange mystic that upon seeing her invites her to come in and talk.  Asking 
him questions teaches her much about her new world.  Strangely he knows about 
her entrance from the closet, and informs her that she will not be able to get back
because there is a force holding it closed.  To disable the force will require
some research and aquisition of powers the mystic can not provide.  Thus
he suggests that she explore the land and see what she can find.

throughout the market are hidden powerups, so exploring here is a good thing.

NOTEs: she doesn't find her vehicle until later, inner and outer atla she is 
walking and building her character Zelda 64 style.

<h1>OUTER ATLA (JUNGLE WITH CLEARINGS)</h1>
<p>
Here powerups are found in organic containers:  mushroom stools, on enemies,  
etc...  Also found in plain view: floating items, gems. 
(expand on this, gameplay, enemies, puzzles, etc...)
Hidden is an entrance to the subterrainian world.


<h1>SUBTERRAIN ATLA (ROCKY + TECHNOLOGY)</h1>
<p>
lots of loderunner and mario action (ledges, weapon/item/wealth powerups, 
enemies).  Here is where she vinds a vehicle, appanently it was being stored
by some techomancer...  To find it she solved 3 puzzles involving locks.
The locks are not standard locks, but must be cleverly triggered.  Inspection 
of the world are all the hints she has.

<h2>1st puzzle</h2>
<p>
10 rooms.
press wall plates in a long winding corridor.  The number above the plate
opens the door with that number.  you as a player need to notice that the 
numbers may be connected with each other.

<h2>2nd puzzle</h2>
<p>
she finds a key that emits a short tune.  match this to the door that 
emits the same tune.

<h2>3rd puzzle</h2>
<p>
she finds a new kind of object that when "used" it emits a burst of energy
(or bullet)...  The burst always exits from the same direction (world aligned)
no matter how she drops the item on the ground.  She can "use" it while it
is on the ground, or while it is in her inventory.  Shooting it with a weapon
will redirect the burst in the object's direction as well (only with certain 
gun).  There will be a timed door that when triggered will close again after 
2 seconds.  Unfortunately for Aki the trigger is just too far away.  She 
must place the shooting object near the trigger and shoot at it while standing 
near the door.


<p>
The vehicle is too big to fit through the way she came, and must exit out a 
larger tunnel, which leads her to a new world....  Plans on the walls of this
cave showed that the vehicle is a prototype design.  The plans illustrate
the vehicle's advanced capabilities.  currently, the vehicle can do the normal 
driving plus straef and jump.  she soon notices that the vehicle is upgradable 
when she finds a simple weapon for it (drive over it to pick it up).

<p>
NOTE: the addition of the vehicle adds the need to find power for it.  If the
vehicle power runs out, then Aki's health meter is displayed, but will probably 
run out fast if against a vehicle-strength enemy...  If vehicle power becomes 
too low, it will sink to the ground unable to move.  Aki is able to get out and
find vehicle power cells or repair kits.




<h1>OTHER LEVELS</h1>
<p>
describe some levels here.  going into details about the puzzles and
strategy in each part.  describe items and enemies too.  give sketches
or pictures of the map for each level (concept or fully planned)...   

<p>
I want at least 3 of the levels themed to each of the following,
<ul>
<li>Mayan villages, african/mayan jungle  (atla)
<li>nile river valley
<li>ancient crete
</ul>

 <li>can run, walk or jump (like mario)
 <li>not afraid of anything
 <li>anime/cartoony style.  
   we need a good balance so that she's not awkward to control like tomb 
   raider.  mario and zelda are both really easy to control (maybe because
   of character proportions?)  she can turn on a dime, is controled while 
   she jumps, etc...  
 <li>she can "jump", "use", "fire", "change weapon", "straef", crouch maybe too...
 <li>some weapons auto aim, but not all.

<h3>Map rooms</h3>
<P>These are rooms inside of an area that are a map of the area.  That is, they contain a map of the area as tiles on the floor.  The tiles will
be generated as Aki moves through the dungeon, and Aki can return to the maproom to teleport to certain rooms in the area.</P>
<h3>Save Crystals<h3>
<P>
Aki must find these to save her progress.  They will usually be placed after a series of puzzles, or one really nasty puzzle.  Ideally, the flow
of puzzles, save crystals, and more puzzles shoulld fill the player with a sense of accomplishment once they locate a save puzzle.

begin, and should give the artists an idea of the type of work they'll need to do.  These specifications are kind of lofty at the moment,
since most of the team is doubling as at least two different positions :P</td>

hmmm...  probably will take a while.

  - does not stop gameplay! :)
- triggered items
  - some remote control weapon (box that shoots, like in ankh)
    - the remote control can be picked up separately of course. :)
  - timed door who's trigger is in another room 
    (thus you'd have to use the remote control 
     weapon to push the button for you)

  - save crystals found at every checkpoint give you the opportunity 
    to save them up and choose when they are used.
  - save is allowed at game exit (we're not cruel)
  - cheat mode gives a quick save anytime, but you don't get treasure.
  - consider this... quicksave available everywhere except for in areas 
    near the end of the level.
- lives
  - just one (like diablo ii)
  - you have a health meter (power ups will be available)
- vehicles
  - after certain "special" enemies are killed, you can repair their ship
    - and use it.
  - issue... how to repair the ship?
    - aki carries a repair kit found in special aki-only areas of the map
  - need to switch vehicles
    - new tank allows you to jump higher to a place you need to get to
    - more inventory but slower ship (or less and faster)
    - tank weapons can't transfer (cause the aki can't carry them!)
- camera (like mario64)
- enemies
  - when you learn the puzzles, the this can give the game replay
  - makes the game more fun, harder when puzzles are easy.
  - some can be buried, some jumpsquashed.  most can be shot, but not some. :)
  

TODO: break all this stuff out into chapters.  should make a nice 50
page doc when done. :)
