The directory tree for the module is planned to be structured like so:
root/
        doc/
        src/
        test/

Most of the files should be in InterCaps.

Examples:
  SomeDocument.txt
  ImageLoader.cpp
  BMPExporter.h

Avoid hard tabs in files.  When they exist, they should be eight
characters.
