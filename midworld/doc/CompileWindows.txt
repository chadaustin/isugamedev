First:   Get a SourceForge account and tell me the username so I can
         add you to the isugamedev project.
Second:  Get Cygwin if you don't have it.
Third:   From a Cygwin prompt, run the following commands.

export CVS_RSH=ssh
export CVSROOT=your-sf-username@cvs.isugamedev.sf.net:/cvsroot/isugamedev
cvs co midworld

You will have to enter your password.

Now that Midworld is hopefully checked out from CVS properly, you will
need to get the game resources.

cd midworld
./get-resources.sh

Open the solution in the midworld/vc7 directory and compile Midworld.
Copy the resource directories from build/ to vc7/midworld/Release/ and
vc7/midworld/Debug/
