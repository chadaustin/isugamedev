  <h1>Collision Detection Design</h1>
  <p>This document describes the design of the collision detection system used
  within midworld.</p>

  <h2>Algorithm Discussion</h2>
  <p>We need a utility that will detect collisions between many moving rigid
  bodies in order to apply realistic physics to those bodies.

  <h3>Assumptions</h3>
  <p>The following assumptions are made of the physical system.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Bodies are being moved in real-time using small time steps.</li>
   <li>A given application will only need to test each moving body against all
       other bodies in the scene as though they are static. In other words,
       since the time steps are small, the application does not care about time
       dependent collisions such as when two bodies collide with each other. We
       will assume that body A collides with body B and then body B collides
       with body A; the collisions do not happen at the same time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>High Level Overview</h3>
  <p>Given the above assumptions, we shall use a two-pass collision detection
  system to solve the problem.</p>
  <ol>
   <li><b>Fast, rough cull</b>
    <p>All objects whose bounding volumes intersect with the current object's
    bounding volume will be culled for further examination. This shall be
    implemented using a spatial index implemented using a scene graph, R-Tree,
    Oct Tree, OBB Tree, etc.</p>
   </li>
   <li><b>Slow, exact intersection</b>
    <p>Each object's polygonal bounds will be intersected in detail with the
    current object's polygonal bounds. This shall be implemented using a
    low-level intersection algorithm such as V-Clip.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <h2>Algorithm Interfaces</h2>
  <p><pre>

 * A physical body that cannot be deformed. For collision detections, we only
 * care about its bounding volume.
 */

 * Provides a way to access rigid bodies based on their spatial properties.
 * This can be implemented as a SceneGraph, RTree, OctTree, OBBTree, etc.
 */
interface SpatialIndex
{
   /**
    * Finds the bodies whose bounds intersect the given region.
    *
    * @param region     the search region that bodies will be tested against
    *
    * @return  a list of intersecting bodies
    */
   list&lt;RigidBody&gt; intersect(AABB region);

 * Describes the details of a collision between two rigid bodies.
 */

{
   /// The body that the collider hits.
   RigidBody collidee;

   /// Normal of the surface of the collidee at the point of collision.
   Vec3f normal;

   /// The distance travelled along the path to the point of collision.
   float distance;
}

/**

 * bodies in a dynamic system.
 */

{
   /**
    * Determines if the given rigid body collides with any other rigid bodies
    * in the given spatial index as it travels along the given path.
    *
    * @param body    the body that is the collider
    * @param path    the path along which the body must travel
    * @param index   the spatial index of all bodies in the dynamic system
    *
    * @return  a description of the collision, null if there is no collision
    */
   CollisionDesc checkCollision(RigidBody body, Vec3f path, SpatialIndex index);
}

  <h2>Private API</h2>
  <p><pre>

 * bodies.

   /**
    * Determines the distance between two convex polyhedra.
