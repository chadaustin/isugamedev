  <h1>Midworld Collision Detection Design</h1>
  <p>This document describes the design of the collision detection system used
  within Midworld.</p>

  <h2>Introduction</h2>
  <p>We need a utility that will detect collisions between many moving rigid
  bodies in order to apply realistic physics to those bodies. Detecting
  collisions between rigid bodies is key to having a good dynamics
  simulator.</p>

  <p>Since the schedule for Midworld is tight - only 3 months - the design for
  the collision detection system must be scalable. In other words, the
  interfaces must be laid in early so that we can start with a slow, easy to
  implement algorithm and hide upgrades to better algorithms as we finish them.
  In this way we should be able to do quick prototyping and still allow for
  excellent algorithms in the final product.</p>

  <h2>Definitions</h2>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Rigid Body</b> -
    An object that does not change shape during the simulation. Rigid bodies can
    be linked together by putting joints between them to allow for articulated
    movement, but they cannot change from strain exerted on them.
   </li>
   <li><b>PCS</b> -
    <b>P</b>otentially <b>C</b>ollidable <b>S</b>et. Refers to a set of rigid
    bodies that have a good chace of colliding with the collider object. This is
    usually used as the result of a first pass in a collision detection system.
   </li>
   <li><b>Spatial Index</b> -
    A utility that allows the selection of rigid bodies based on their spatial
    characteristics. A typical spatial index will allow you to retrieve all
    bodies whose bounds intersect with a given search bounds.
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Assumptions</h3>
  <p>The following assumptions are made of the physical system.</p>
  <ul>
   <li>Bodies are being moved in real-time using small time steps.</li>
   <li>A given application will only need to test each moving body against all
       other bodies in the scene as though they are static. In other words,
       since the time steps are small, the application does not care about time
       dependent collisions such as when two bodies collide with each other. We
       will assume that body A collides with body B and then body B collides
       with body A; the collisions do not happen at the same time.</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>High Level Overview</h3>
  <p>Given the above assumptions, we shall use a two-pass collision detection
  system to solve the problem.</p>
  <ol>
   <li><b>Fast, rough cull</b>
    <p>All objects whose bounding volumes intersect with the current object's
    bounding volume will be culled for further examination. This shall be
    implemented using a spatial index implemented using a scene graph, R-Tree,
    Oct Tree, OBB Tree, etc.</p>
   </li>
   <li><b>Slow, exact intersection</b>
    <p>Each object's polygonal bounds will be intersected in detail with the
    current object's polygonal bounds. This shall be implemented using a
    low-level intersection algorithm such as V-Clip.</p>
   </li>
  </ol>

  <h3>Implementation Schedule</h3>
  <ol>
   <li><b>Brute Force</b>
    <p><code>CollisionDetector</code> will be implemented using the brute force
    approach. It will iterate over every body in the scene and do a bounds test
    against the collider. If bounds collide, then the bodies collide.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
<pre>
collisions = empty list
foreach collider in the scene
{
   move collider to the end of the path
   foreach body in the scene
   {
      // Don't collide with self
      if body == collider
      {
         continue
      }
      if body.bounds intersects with collider.bounds
      {
         add body to collisions
      }
   }
}
</pre>
    </blockquote>
   </li>
   <li><b>Bounds Collider</b>
    <p><code>CollisionDetector</code> will be implemented by moving the rigid
    body to the end of the path and querying its bounds at that location against
    the spatial index. <code>IntersectionAlgorithm</code> will be implemented to
    simply return any points on the bodies.</p>
    <blockquote>
     <h4>Pseudocode</h4>
<pre>
collisions = empty list
foreach body in the scene
{
   move body to the end of the path
   pcs = all bodies in the spatial index who intersect with body's bounds
   if pcs is not empty
   {
      add the first item in the pcs to collisions
   }
}
</pre>
    </blockquote>
   </li>
  </ol>

   /// The body that the collider hits.
   RigidBody collidee;

   /// Normal of the surface of the collidee at the point of collision.
   Vec3f normal;

   /// The distance travelled along the path to the point of collision.
   float distance;
}

/**

 * bodies in a dynamic system.
 */

{
   /**
    * Determines if the given rigid body collides with any other rigid bodies
    * in the given spatial index as it travels along the given path.
    *
    * @param body    the body that is the collider
    * @param path    the path along which the body must travel
    * @param index   the spatial index of all bodies in the dynamic system
    *
    * @return  a description of the collision, null if there is no collision
    */
   CollisionDesc checkCollision(RigidBody body, Vec3f path, SpatialIndex index);
