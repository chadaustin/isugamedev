Right now, this is just cut and pasted from our e-mails.  Refactor as
necessary.

We decided to make a game that was sort of like Target Quake.  We agreed upon 
2D, and I believe on top down view as well.  The setting is a post nuclear 
setting with retro fifties car, and the user interface will be Gattaca style. 
Controls will be done with the mouse via a crosshair that appears out in 
front of the player on screen.  

Some of the item ideas:
Homing Missiles
Grenades
Plasma
Spread Shot

We also decided to use variable time step as opposed to terrain, and we will 
be using flat terrain.  

For the first revision, we will use square baddies (possible cubes), and hope 
to get the movement and some of the animation underway, as well as some of 
the collision detection.
