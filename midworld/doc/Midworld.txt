Midworld
Design Document

1.  Overview

	1.1  Game
	
	Midworld is a 2D shooter game sort of like Target Quake.  The player 
	will run around and shoot things using a crosshair that stands out in 
	front of the player.  The view will be top-down, and the terrain will
	not be tile based.  The player will run around and shoot things in a
	post nuclear world that contains a retro fifties/Gattaca style.  

2.  Objective

	2.1  To blow things up with a multitude of weapons and items.
	2.2  To enjoy 2.1

3.  Graphics

	The graphics in Midworld will not be tile based, but will instead be
	pieces of loaded images merged into a map, or a randomly generated 
	terrain map.  The camera will be top down, and a crosshair will stand 
	out in front of the player.  The player will move the character by 
	acceleration and deceleration keys and will turn the character by 
	rotating the crosshair with the mouse.  

4.  Weapons

	4.1  Homing Missiles
	
	Missiles that home in on an enemy.  Ideas were to make the missiles
	shoot up towards the camera first, and then have them streak after the
	oppenent in a circular fashion, or to have the rotate around the player
	first, and then swirl around on the screen after the opponent.
	
	4.2  Grenades
	
	Grenades are lobbed by the player in the air and bounce a few times on
	the ground before detonating.
	
	4.3  Plasma
	
	Plasma shoots a plasma ball towards the enemies; nothing special here,
	just a standard shot.

	4.4  Spread Shot
	
	Think Contra :)  The spread shot will shoot several smaller plasma 
	shots in a spread formation.  
	
5.  Controls

	The controls will move both the character and the crosshair.  The
	player can rotate the crosshair, and move the character forward and 
	backward.  Additionally, the player will be able to make the character
	strafe to the left and to the right.
