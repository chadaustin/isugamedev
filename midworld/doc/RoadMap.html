  <h2>Iteration 1 (28 June 2002)</h2>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Moveable Main Character</b><br>
    The main character should be moveable by the player. The player should
    always face the mouse cursor. The player should be able to rotate using the
    mouse, move forward, move backward, strafe left, and strafe right using the
    keyboard.
   </li>
   <li><b>AI Framework</b><br>
    The framework for the AI system should be defined, but not yet integrated
    into the game.
   </li>
   <li><b>Collision Detection Framework</b><br>
    The framework for the Collision Detection system should be defined, but not
    yet integrated into the game.
   </li>
   <li><b>Random Enemies</b><br>
    A set number of enemies will begin the game that will walk about in random
    directions. They shall be represented as cubes.
   </li>
   <li><b>Physics Engine (Linear)</b><br>
    A basic physics engine should be implemented that at least handles linear
    movement and forces.
   </li>
   <li><b>Basic Weapon Functionality</b><br>
    The player should be able to fire off shots of cubical bullets in the
    direction he/she is facing.
   </li>
   <li><b>Visible Terrain</b><br>
    There should be some type of terrain that is visible so that the player is
    not moving along a dark (or bright) mass.
   </li>
   <li><b>Integration with GameKernel</b><br>
    Midworld should be run as a GameKernel application.
   </li>
  </ul>

  <h2>Iteration 2 (5 July 2002)</h2>
  <ul>
   <li><b>Model Loading</b><br>
    Cubes should be replaced with models loaded from disk, using a scenegraph
    such as OpenSG or OpenSceneGraph.
   </li>
   <li><b>Collision Detection (Basic)</b><br>
    Basic collision detection should be integrated so that we can do some
    initial bounds collision tests.
   </li>
   <li><b>Physics Engine (Torque)</b><br>
    The physics engine should support torque forces.
   </li>
   <li><b>Maps Loaded From Disk</b><br>
    Maps should be loaded from disk from some sort of file format.
   </li>
  </ul>
