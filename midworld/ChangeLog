---------- -----------  -------------------------------------------------------
2002-09-09 nonchocoboy  Removed dependency between states through the use of
                        a new StateFactory. States now invoke transitions to
                        each other by name and the factory creates the
                        necessary implementation.
2002-09-09 nonchocoboy  Added caching semantics to the SoundEffectManager so
                        that sound effects are loaded into memory when they are
                        first needed and then reused thereafter.
