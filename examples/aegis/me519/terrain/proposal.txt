ME 519 Final Project Proposal
Chad Austin


When I was in high school, I played a lot of video games.  It's pretty
much what got me into graphics.  As I got older, I got smarter, and
thus I could actually create games and various graphics programs on my
own.  However, my time available to do these things became more and
more limited.  It culminated this semester...  for the first time in
my college experience, I took too many programming classes.
Fortunately, I realized I could develop components for a game I want
to make in these classes.

Now, on to the proposal for my final project.  The final goal is a
multiplayer, turn-based strategy game in a medieval world...  wizards
and knights and armies and big magic battles and all that jazz.  :D
One of the most important pieces of the game is rendering the terrain.
For my final project, I'd like to work on an octree-based terrain
renderer with support for rendering at different levels of detail.

I have this really clear vision as to what it should look like in my
head, but I can't exactly explain it in text form...  I see lots of
nice, green textures...  and cool water...  :)


Milestones
--

- generate initial terrain using plasma subdivision or loading from a
  heightmap
- render terrain with seamless textures
- add support for variable LOD
- optimize rendering with an octree (or maybe I just need a quadtree?)
