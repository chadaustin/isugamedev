<h1>Chad Austin's Breakout</h1>

<p>
Since I've been really busy, I couldn't spend as much time as I would have
liked on this project.  It has a few bugs in the collision detection
routines...  Sometimes the ball may get stuck in the walls or travel up through
the crack between two blocks.  I did add sound effects using my
<a href="http://aegisknight.org/audiere">audio library</a>, however (and
thereby found a few issues with the performance of the library in interactive
situations).
</p>

<p>
I think the assignment took me three hours.
