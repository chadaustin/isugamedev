<h3>readme.html</h3>

<p>
This file.
</p>

<h3>Makefile</h3>

<p>
Cygwin makefile.
</p>

<h3>wpaint.cpp</h3>

<p>
Paint program source.  I learned new STL from it too, specifically:
</p>

<code>
for_each(container.begin(), container.end(), mem_fun(&Command::draw));
</code>

<p>
That rules.  :)
</p>

<h3>wpaint1.exe</h3>

<p>
This program satisfied (almost) every assignment requirement.  It implemented
rubber banding by remembering every command that had been drawn, and therefore
could remove the most recently-created command and add the new one.
</p>

<h3>wpaint2.exe</h3>

<p>
I added transparency to this version.  The new "Transparency" menu allows you
to select any translucency level between 0% and 100% in 10% increments.
</p>

<h3>wpaint3.exe</h3>

<p>
Version 3 has support for undo and redo.  This was trivial to implement.
</p>

<h3>wpaint4.exe</h3>

<p>
I enabled GL_POINT_SMOOTH so points looked nicer.  I also forgot to make line
width modify the width of scribble and outlined rectangles.  ^_^
