  <h2>Summary</h2>
  <p>Munch Master is a simple rip-off of the classic PacMan.

  <h2>Gameplay Overview</h2>
  <p>You are the infamous Munch Master. Somebody has left tasty pellets all over
  the place and it's your job to make sure they get eaten. Sounds easy right?
  Well, here's the twist. That same somebody left some nasty ghosts around to
  protect those pellets and those ghosts think you're the food! Thankfully there
  are some special "power pellets" lieing around that make you a super-de-duper
  Munch Master allowing you to eat the ghosts for a short time. But alas, they
  are ghosts and cannot be killed. You can only divert them for a short while.

  <p>Basically each level starts with the player being dropped into a maze
  filled with pellets, power pellets and ghosts. The player cannot progress to
  the next level until they have eaten all of the pellets in the maze.
  Throughout this time, there are four ghosts that live in the ghost home. Once
  the level starts, they will leave their home and chase after Munch Master. If
  any of the ghosts touch Munch Master, he dies and the player must start again
  where he left off on that level.

  <p>If the player eats a power pellet, then the ghosts become edible to Munch
  Master for a short period of time. If a ghost is eaten, they will float back
  to their home where they will respawn to attack Munch Master once again.
