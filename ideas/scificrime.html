<center><h2>Game idea #2:<br>Scifi/crime adventure</h2></center>

<h3>Theme</h3>

<p>The main themes are <b>justice</b> and <b>accepting culpability</b>.  
You remotely access a robot on the spaceship that was the scene of a 
crime to figure out where it is located and, in the end, make sure that 
those responsible are brought to justice.</p>

<h3>Style</h3>

<p>I haven't made any stylistic decisions yet.  These will be limited by 
what is possible with the tools and talents available.  The camera view 
is from behind and a little above your robot.</p>

<h3>Conflict</h3>

<p>The gameplay conflict is mostly player vs. physics again.  The player 
will use <b>exploration</b>, capability augmentation, and <b>cleverness</b> 
to overcome mobility barriers (locked doors, high walls, etc.) and a few 
"boss" robots that oppose your goal.</p>

<p>The conflict in the motivational plot is more complex and best 
described with a story synopsis.</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><td><h4>Synopsis</h4>

<p>A defiant felon is taken to his cell after being betrayed to the police 
by his partner, whom is still at large.  As the game begins, you are a 
detective trying to gather evidence to convict him.  From your account on 
the police network, you have accessed a little robot on the spaceship where 
the masacre took place.  Your must determine the physical location of the 
ship so it can be taken as evidence.</p>

<p>The damaged ship is difficult for your robot to navigate, but after 
installing a longer manipulation arm and restoring power to the hatch you 
reach the bridge.  You access the security film of the crime.  The suspects' 
attempt to hijack the ship went wrong and killed the crew held in the cargo 
bay.  The man took the escape shuttle alone when his distraught female 
partner ran the wrong way as toxins spread throughout the ship.  Her tip to 
the police about their rendezvous point led to his arrest.</p>

<p>The ship's navigation systems are malfunctioning, but when you try to fix 
them someone else logged in catches you online.  Maybe the woman survived...
sealled off part of the ship before the toxic gasses killed her.</p>

<p>You set out to find her, but the ship is on yellow alert.  You scavenge a 
hover field generator from another robot after it tries to reprogram yours, 
and with it you reach the systems administration area and download a higher 
security protocol.  Now you can enter the cargo bay and follow the path that 
the woman took.</p>

<p>The cargo bay is heavily damaged from the explosion that ruptured the 
gas canisters--a kamikaze act by the hijacked soldiers.  Bodies litter the 
floor...except for one person in a hazard suit.  The truth comes out when 
you confront the woman.  You're no detective; you're her partner.  You 
hacked into the police systems to locate the ship so your clients can find 
it and try to buy your freedom in return.  But, certain revenge is better than 
half a chance at freedom.  You can turn her in...or finish her off yourself...</p>

<p>She has other ideas--to sell the ship and take the money for herself.  
Funny, how easily money turned her against you.</p>

<p>Suddenly, one of the dead bodies gets up.  Hidden beneath it, a humanoid 
defense robot jumps out and attacks your little robot, breaking off its new 
arm.  The only escape is to run.  She sneaks away as you retreat from the 
cargo bay to look for a different way in.</p>

<p>In your search you find a coupling that lets you to flip the polarity of 
your magnetic hover field.  Now you can drive up metal walls and across 
ceilings.  Risky maneuvers lead you through a back route to her hideaway.</p>

<p>Her defense robot attacks, but your reverse hover destroys it.  You install 
it's weapon arm in place of your broken one.  From beneath her gas mask, she 
watches your battle without a flicker of emotion, and when you approach she 
doesn't move.</p>

<p>If it's a trick, you're not falling for it.  At gunpoint, you command her 
to turn herself in or you'll carry out her inevitable death sentence yourself.  
She coolly refuses.  You were supposed to be theives, not murderers.  Guilt 
haunts her, and you realize that she wants you to kill her.  When she sees that 
you're not going to, she takes her mask off and immediately chokes on the 
deadly gasses that killed the crew.

<p>Your little robot is helpless to stop her, and more than that, the police 
have finally detected your illegal use of their network.  They sever your 
connection.  Changed by your adventure, you confess your guilt and are 
sentenced to die for your crimes.</p>

<h3>Control</h3>

<p>The controls are defined with the same conventions as in <a 
href="gamedes1.htm">game idea #1</a>.  The following text labels represent 
their corresponding buttons on a typical control pad:
<pre>
    _____        _____
 __|_[L]_|______|_[R]_|__
|                        |
|     U           (^)    |
|   L   R       (<) (>)  |
|     D     [s]   (v)    |
|________________________|</pre></p>

<p>The "life" of the robot is its electrical power level.  When you run 
out of electricity, the game is over.  Movement and other mechanical 
actions use electricity.  Damaged systems use more power to operate.  
If you are damaged beyond repair then the game is also over.</p>

<h4>Movement</h4>

<p>Your little robot drives on two treads (right and left).  The 
directional buttons are mapped to the analog control axes shown 
below.</p>

<h4>Action</h4>

<p>Throughout the game your robot will gain additional capabilities 
like perhaps a hover field, amplifier, polar switch, manipulator arm, 
gun arm, redundant power supply, firewall, and an upgrade to a newer 
version of the computer systems' control protocol.  The game control 
specification below is only tentative.</p>

<table border=1>
<tr><td colspan=2>Controls for actions</td></tr>
<tr>
<td><tt>(v)</tt></td>
<td>wireless hack into nearby computer systems to open doors, fend off 
other robots, etc. (situation dependent)</td>

<td>(manipulator arm) use right arm to grab, push, pull, carry, or strike 
(situation dependent)</td>
</tr><tr><td>(gun arm) shoot</td>

<h3>Challenges to the Developer</h3>

<p>Software tools necessary to implement the above design are:
<ul><li>physics simulation -- for robot "vehicle" movement</li>
<li>computer modeling and animation package -- for level and character creation</li>
<li>artificial intelligence -- for robot antagonists</li>
<li>movie player -- for dramatic cut scenes</li>
<li>digital film editing suite -- for dramatic cut scenes</li>
<li>as well as lighting, rendering, animation, and input handling code</li></ul></p>

<p>I am not an artist so my level design and character modeling and animation 
would not be as good as those of an artist (if I can do them at all).  I would 
need to enlist the help of others to handle the non-programming, non-design 
tasks that this project would require.</p>
