<h2>1. Intro</h2>
<p>Criminal Acts is a strategy game at heart intermixed with fast first-person
action. The game revolves around the player trying to either take control of the
city as a criminal or to keep the peace as a cop.

<h2>2. Gameplay Overview</h2>
<p>Criminal Acts can be generalized to two main modes of gameplay - strategy and
action.

<p>The strategy part of the game is fulfilled through the player trying to gain
control of the city as a criminal. The action game derives from the intense
action and high tension usually found when performing a criminal act such as
holding up a bank, stealing a vehicle or evading the cops in a car chase.

<p>Initially the player starts as a rather unskilled street thug strapped for
cash with dreams of controlling the city. The player can make money and build
skills by committing small time crimes such as pickpocketing or by performing
jobs for local gangs.

<p>Once the player begins to gain power within a gang, they are gradually given
control over the actions of that gang. This is where the strategic element comes
into play. The player will direct his cronies to perform some action on a person
or at a location and allow them to go do the dirty work. The player is of course
allowed (if not encouraged) to go along. The focus of this part of the game will
be for the player to expand his turf. This is achieved through instilling fear
and submission into the citizens of the neighborhoods you control. The most
common way to achieve this will be through bullying the local businesses to pay
for "protection." This way the player can make money as well as maintain their
turf. Of course the shopkeepers will need to be frequently reminded as to why
they need protection.

<p>All through this time it is imperitive that the player is not killed or
arrested by the cops. The more notorious a player gets through their actions on
the street, the more wanted he becomes. It will then become in the player's best
interest to either avoid the cops, surround himself with bodyguards, pay off the
cops or kill the cops.

<p>All this time, the environment is a real living, breathing city. Citizens are
goal oriented with schedules to keep and lives to lead. The player should be
able to notice patterns of a persons behavior just as they would in the real
world. Thus if rich Granny Irene walks along Main St. to meet her friends for
lunch every thursday at 11am after making a withdrawl from her bank, the player
can take advantage of this knowledge to snatch her purse one week. Another
noticable schedule will be that of public transportation such as buses and
trains.

<p>Since the player is interacting in a fully dynamic world, the citizens will
react to the player's actions. If the player blows up a building, the police,
firefighters and paramedics arrive to clean up the mess. Firefighters also
respond to any fire and try to put it out quickly. Paremedics respond to any
reports of injury. Victims are either rushed to the hospital or the morque. If
the player destroys a building or other structure, cleanup and construction
crews will arrive to clean up the mess and build new structures in its place.

<p>A world only feels real if physical events cause expected results. Thus
Criminal Acts allows the player to destroy anything. People, cars, lampposts,
signs, fire hydrants and buildings are at the player's mercy.

<h2>3. Platforms</h2>
<p>Initial target platforms will be Win32, Linux and Irix (SGI). The core of the
graphics engine will be written with OpenGL in mind. However, since it would be
nice to port the game to platforms such as the X-Box, it would be advisable not
to hardcode the graphics API to OpenGL so that we can easily move to DirectX.
Target platforms will be assumed to have 3D accelerated video hardware.

<p>If possible it would be nice to allow Criminal Acts to support using
VRJuggler as well as OpenGL for the graphics API. This will allow the game to
run in the C6 virtual reality cave. However, this is obviously not a
high-priority item.

<h2>4. World Views</h2>
<p>There are three primary views in Criminal Acts: Walking, Driving and City
views. All views are implemented as 3D scenes. Transitions between views are
handled seamlessly in order to maximize the player's immersion in the game. Of
course, all views are configurable.  The player will have the choice of which
view will be best for him/her.  For example, he or she will be able to choose
from a FPS style of view or a 3-d top down iso which can be panned and zoomed.

<h3>4.1 Walking View</h3>
<p>Whenever the player is freely walking about the city the game will take on
the feel of a first-person shooter. In this view, the player may navigate about
the world using <i>Quake</i> style navigation. Hand-held weapons may be used in
this view.

<h3>4.2 Driving View</h3>
<p>While the player drives a vehicle the camera will reside at a third-person
perspective a ways above and behind the vehicle similar to that seen in
<i>Driver</i> and <i>Midtown Madness</i>. In this case however, as the vehicle's
velocity increases, the chase camera will pull back from the vehicle in order to
show more of the terrain ahead of the player so they can navigate more easily.

<h3>4.3 City View</h3>
<p>The city view is composed of a map of the city. To make this view as seamless
as possible with the other views, this view is implemented as the player holding
up a paper map into the Walking View (see S4.1). It is through this view that
the player is able to give high-level instructions to his cronies so that they
may wreak havok on the city. Using the mouse, the player may select the
buildings on the map that his thugs should interact with as well as select the
action that should be performed.

<h2>5. The City</h2>
<p>The city is the primary environment in which the player interacts. It is
officially divided into police precincts. The boundaries for these precincts are
dependent on the size of the police force working for that precinct and the
number of citizens living in the area.

<p>Unofficially, the city is divided into gang territories each controlled by a
separate gang. The territories will expand and shrink dynamically as the game
plays depending on the influence that gang has on the area. Thus the size of a
particular gang's territory will be a function of how much the citizens in that
area fear them as well as how much activity that gang performs in the area. In
this way the player must continue to manage their turf and cannot assume that
once they control an area they can forget about it and assume that it's theirs
for the rest of the game.

<p>Citizens within the city each have their own agenda. They may work or stay at
home. They may live in one part of the city and commute to another. They may
live in the same building that they work in. Thus each citizen will live out
their life by sleeping, going to work, working, going home, going out to eat,
going to a movie, etc. much in the way the player would expect out of a person
in the real world.

<p>The city is also reactive to the player.  This means that the player has the
ability to modify his/her suroundings.  For example, if the player has a few
barrels of gasoline, a grenade, and a nasty burr up his ass, he or she can proceed 
to blow stuff up and it will in fact happen in the game as it would in real life.
For example, large guns will do physical damage to walls, doors, windows, mailboxes,
etc.  Explosives will do damage to larger objects, like vehicles, buildings, or
anything else the player wants.

<h3>5.1 Moving About the City</h3>
<p>The player has three ways to move about the city. They can walk, take the
public transportation or steal a car and drive. Walking and driving are probably
going to be the most popular and most effective ways to get about.

<h4>5.1.1 Walking</h4>
<p>While the player is walking about, the game will take on the form like that
of a first-person shooter. The player will see the environment from a
first-person perspective. While using this method of transportation, the player
may also carry and use weapons. Unlike most trigger-happy first person shooters,
the player will not just be able to walk about unnoticed while holding an uzi or
a rocket launcher. Thus the player will want to hide the weapon under their coat
until it is needed so that they do not get arrested.

<h4>5.1.2 Public Transportation</h4>
<p>Public transportation exists in the city in the form of buses, trains and
the subway. These all run according to a set schedule barring any problems such
as a train wreck or a traffic jam. If the player so wishes they may hijack any
of these vehicles and control them as though they were controlling any other
vehicle in the game.

<h4>5.1.3 Driving Vehicles</h4>
<p>Stealing and driving vehicles proved to be very useful and rewarding in
<i>Grand Theft Auto</i>. Criminal Acts will provide this functionality as well.
At any time, the player may steal a vehicle from a citizen, parking lot, etc.
and take it for a spin about the city. This part of the game will play much more
like <i>Midtown Madness</i> and <i>Driver</i>.

<h2>6. The Citizens</h2>
<p>Each citizen is assigned a home, a place of work, their primary method of
transportation (i.e. a car), an amount of money, a personality and set of
skills. Each simulated day, each citizen will make decisions that directly
affect their actions. This involves the route that they use to go to work,
whether they go out to eat or bring a lunch, whether they are good drivers, etc.

<h3>6.1 Personality</h3>
<p> There will be several personalities that will be used as bases which will
help in determining how a person acts (as person I mean NPC) in the game.
Everything from very shy all the way up to "psyco triggerhappy I have flashbacks
every five minutes" kind of person will be incorporated.  These are not the sole
determinates of behavior.  The personality is just to give a basic guideline
on how a person will react to certain situations.
<h4> Basic Personalities: </h4>
<ul>
 <li> Withdrawn
 <li> Outgoing
 <li> Disgruntled
 <li> Happy
 <li> Courageous
 <li> Weak Willed
 <li> Strong Willed
 <li> Nice
 <li> Helpfull
 <li> Rude
 <li> Jerk
</ul>
<p> These different types of personalities can be mixed and matched in order
to create a truely unique person.  The personalities will come into play when 
the NPC encounters certain situations.  Then if an NPC has a certain personality
trait then he or she will go down certain paths for deciding on how he or she
will act in that situation.

<h2>7. Crimes</h2>
<p>This is an attempt to brainstorm/summarize all the crimes the player is
allowed to commit while playing this game.
<p><ul>
 <li>Vandalism
 <ul>
  <li>Egging
  <li>TPing
  <li>Graffiti
  <li>Tire slashing
 </ul>
 <li>Robbery
 <ul>
  <li>Purse snatching
  <li>Small shop theft
  <li>Bank holdup
  <li>Grand theft auto
 </ul>
 <li>Bootlegging
 <li>Selling alcohol to minors
 <li>Drug trafficking
 <li>Blackmail
 <li>Kidnapping
 <li>Assault
 <li>Manslaughter
 <li>Murder
 <li>Stealing candy from kids
</ul>

<h2>8. Weapons</h2>
<p>A variety of weapons will be available to the player. However, unlike most
games in action genre, the player is givin a limit to how much they can carry.
Thus the player may not walk around brandishing a rocket launcher, shotgun, 50
cases of ammo and 3 rockets. It's just not feasible. Following is a summary of
the weapons available to the player.

<h3>8.1 Fists</h3>
<p>Being a pretty basic weapon, the players fists do not do much damage.
However, the player may benefit from using their fists since they won't get
arrested for having hands. Fists are much more likely to knock out a person than
kill them. This is good for muggings.

<h3>8.2 Knife</h3>
<p>The knife causes much more damage that the player's fists and is easy to
conceal since it is small.

<h3>8.3 Pistol</h3>
<p>There will be a number of different types of handguns and rifle like weapons.
Each wepaon will be based on some type of weapon in real life and will have the
same types of effects on people and objects.
