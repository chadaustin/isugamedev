Background
==========
Your illegal activity of choice is stealing cars for cash. However, you're a new
crook in the city of _____ and you lack the respect of the local gangs. However,
you've got dreams of controlling your own gang to make dough and control the
entire city. You must use cunning and good old nastiness to work your way up the
ranks of one of the gangs.

The city is officially broken up into police precincts. The boundaries for these
precincts never change. Unofficially there are also gang territories. Various
gangs each control part of the city. Their territory will expand and shrink as
the game goes on depending on the events that occur.

Perspective
===========
When the player is walking around the city on foot, the game will take on a
first-person perspective. When the player hops into a vehicle, the game will
take on a third-person perspective with a chase camera behind the vehicle.
Transitions between perspectives will be done by smoothly interpolating between
camera positions (i.e. just the start of every N64 Bond level).

Gameplay
========
The player has complete freedom to move about the world and do whatever they
wish. However, their actions will affect the city. Killing citizens will cause
paramedics to arrive on the scene and possibly arouse the suspicions of the
police. Setting fire to a car or building will cause the firefighting squads to
rush to the scene and attempt to put out the fire. The player will generally
not want to alert the police, as being arrested will cost them dearly.

Most of the structured gameplay will come from performing jobs for the local
gangs in order to gain their respects and become a more powerful criminal. This
can range anywhere from stealing a car or delivering money or drugs to the
murder of gang enemies, police or city officials. The player can also
participate in store or bank robberies and even demolish buildings with
explosives.
