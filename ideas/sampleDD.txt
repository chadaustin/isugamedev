1.  	Overview

	1.1 	The Game

	Super-Tank is a level based real-time tank game where each level has highly different objectives.

	1.2  	Overview

	Super-Tank is similar to a first person shooter in that the camera always follows the tank and the user only has control over what the tank?s actions are.  The tank can move in all directions and shoot in all directions.  The tank also has the capacity to jump and land on things hence destroying them.  

	The Camera will have a mario64 style to it.  Following the tank with a dampening effect.  This is to enhance realism and to add additional challenge to the player.  The game will always run in real time.

	Each level the player encounters has a different mission goal.  These mission goals are vastly different in order to test the players skills in many different areas.  There are 4 levels in total with the original package, however future additions may contain a level editor or possible a level loader that could load new levels from disk.
