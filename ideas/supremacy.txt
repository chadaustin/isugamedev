Name
=========
Supremacy (tentative)


Genre
=========
High level description: vehicle combat
Detail description: cross genre - (vehicle combat, capture the flag, some RPG/adventure elements)


Similar to other games?
========================
Supremacy takes ideas from many places:
- BattleTanx (vehicle combat, capture the flag-style missions)
- Heavy Barrel (get weapon parts to build an ultimate weapon)
- Mario Kart series (battle mode free-for-all, varied weapons)
- Metroid (must escape after defeating the boss)
- RPG games (upgradeable stats, allocating points to certain stats, get resources for defeating enemies)
- racing games (equip vehicles with upgrades, e.g. engine)
- Star Fox (vehicle combat, weapon upgrades, end-of-level bosses)
- Twisted Metal series (vehicle combat, weapon types, boses)
- Vigilante 8 (team vehicle combat, weapon types, objectives)

A capture-the-flag game where you use an ACV to destroy the enemies.


Objective
==========
Immediate: Capture a piece of technology from the enemy forces. Destroy any opposition.
Overall: Obtain cutting-edge technology from the enemy corporation with your Antigrav Combat Vehicle (ACV), and use those technologies to destroy them.


Why this game is fun
====================
- variety of weapons and powerups
- increased ACV power level over time
- customizable and upgradeable ACV
- fast action
- possible multiplayer
- multiple levels of difficulty


Target audience
================
Supremacy is for the mid-level to expert gamer. It will start out easy, but each level will get more and more difficult. There will be three difficulty settings that affect the enemies' strength, numbers, and intelligence.


Storyline
============
In the near future two megacorporations have emerged as the dominant economic and political forces in the world - one good, one evil. You are a trained ACV pilot who works for the good corporation. Your mission is to infiltrate the enemy's research and development compounds to seize advanced technology, then use that technology to destroy the threat of the evil corporation. If you do not succeed in your mission, the other (evil) corporation will gain the upper hand, and with it, control of the world. That's bad, because they would cut your pay, stop giving benefits, and probably kill you.


Gameplay
==========
In Supremacy you control an Antigrav Combat Vehicle (ACV, like a hovercraft). The game takes place in large, enclosed levels set in enemy compounds.  For most levels, you exit your corporation's deployment ship into an enemy-controlled area, destroy any opposition, retrieve a piece of technology, and bring it back to the deployment ship. There are many powerups in the compound that you can use to improve your offensive and defensive capabilities. Enemies will attack you will varying levels of ability, depending on the level and difficulty setting. When you destroy them, they will leave behind ammunition, hull armor, and credits to buy things with. There are hidden bonus levels where you can get secret refits, replenish your ammo and armor, and find the pieces of the subatomic destabilizer. Between standard levels you will be able to buy refits for your ACV, as well as additional ammo, with credits. You also get the technology that you took from the enemy in the last level. You can save your game by returning to the deployment vehicle at the beginning of the stage. You win Supremacy by getting all the enemy corporation's technologies and defeating the final boss machine.
