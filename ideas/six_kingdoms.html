<h1>Six Kingdoms</h1>

<p>
This is the design document.
</p>

<h2>Backstory</h2>

<p>
Zoldur is dead.  Of this you are certain.  In Mage's Council you argued
against his plan to perform the Great Alignment ritual.  The issue
split the Six Kingdoms into two opposing factions.  The Dark Ones,
Mages of the Ogres, Kobolds, and Hobgoblins, supported Zoldur's plan
and now seek to capture K'ulwak province for another attempt at the
ritual.  Lacking Zoldur's powers, the Dark Ones are even less likely to
succeed than their former master.  Already the effects of one botched
ritual plague the Six Kingdoms.  The Dark Ones must not be allowed a
second attempt.
</p>

<p>
Recognition of your wisdom in opposing the plan has raised you to head
an alliance of Humans, Elves, and Dwarves wishing to heal the troubled
land.  Marshal your resources, choose well your kings and commanders.
Train your armies and mages to assist them.  Expand your influence and
power for the battle may last many human lifetimes.  But act - someone
must rule the unruly races of the Six Kingdoms.  Zoldur is dead.
Of this you are certain.
